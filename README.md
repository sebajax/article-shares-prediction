# Article Shares Prediction

üçè This repository contains a project for predicting the number of shares an article will receive using three different machine learning models: Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier. The dataset used in this project is the `OnlineNewsPopularity.csv` dataset, which contains various features about online articles.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to predict whether an article will be popular based on various features like content, social engagement, and more. The popularity of an article is determined by the number of shares it receives. This project uses three machine learning models to perform the classification task:

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `OnlineNewsPopularity.csv`. It contains multiple features related to online articles, such as content length, the number of images, and social media engagement metrics.

## Models Used

### 1. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
A powerful classification model that works well with high-dimensional data. It is used here to classify articles based on their predicted popularity.

### 2. Logistic Regression
A widely-used statistical model that is effective for binary classification tasks. It is applied here to predict article popularity.

### 3. Random Forest Classifier
An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
